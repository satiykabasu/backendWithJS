1. check by command line node -v and npm -v
2. we have to make server and whatever data make request to server , we have to make response to that 
in form of api(response)=> all work done by express
3.let you has visit postman.com then there has a server which listen and server will decide what type of 
response it will give; A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol 
and port that you configure :|
4. whenever we are goes to google.com or anyother then it will known as "/" or home route
5. like that we will get different route on different application like someone says to go /login then
there you will get login page , /signup or other
6. there are different type of request comes to the server , basic request is Get | there is other 
request type as well like for updated data , delete data from the server that will be other type of
request 



7. step to start
a. have to make an empty node file via npm init => initilize a package using npm => init is a kind of
utility like CRA or Vite for react || This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults; it will create only one
file

b. here whatever you will write as a description during npm init command run that never goes to the 
server and nothing will shown in the frontend


8. here index.js is the main file but how can we run this file that's why firstly create a index.js file
manually => after that type ls in terminal and if that file can see with include of package.json then
we can run index.js or particular that file with node => now how can run this file using package.json
that's why we are make script command like below,
"scripts": {
    "start":"node index.js"
  },
  after that we will run the command "npm run start" and actully node index.js file gets run =>
  it will be usefull during deploy on the server => here we can not see much more changes but whenever
  we move our file to the server then this script file actully becomes helpful
   output of followin code will be whatever is write inside the index.js file


9. Now everything will done via express(to communicate server and the user device) so have to install it
after install we can see express within dependencies object of package.json
